Project Description
In this project, you'll apply your Python skills to answer a real-world question. You'll aim to discover if Netflix's movies are getting shorter over time using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib. 
You'll also gain experience in an essential data science skill â€” exploratory data analysis.

Project Instructions
What NYC schools have the best math results?

The best math results are at least 80% of the *maximum possible score* for math.
Save your results in a pandas DataFrame called best_math_schools, including "school_name" and "average_math" columns, sorted by "average_math" in descending order.
What are the top 10 performing schools based on the combined SAT scores?

Save your results as a pandas DataFrame called top_10_schools containing the "school_name" and a new column named "total_SAT", with results ordered by "total_SAT" in descending order.
What borough has the largest standard deviation in the combined SAT score?

Save your results as a pandas DataFrame called largest_std_dev.
The DataFrame should contain "borough" as the index, and the following columns:
"num_schools" for the number of schools in the borough.
"average_SAT" for the mean of "total_SAT".
"std_SAT" for the standard deviation of "total_SAT".
Round all numeric values to two decimal places.
